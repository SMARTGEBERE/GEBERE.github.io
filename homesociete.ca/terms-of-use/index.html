<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have done our best to display as accurately as possible the colours of the Products shown on the Websites. However, because the colours you see will depend on your monitor or display, we cannot guarantee that your display of any Product colour will be accurate. While the Websites attempt to be accurate in its product descriptions, G2MC does not represent or warrant that Product descriptions or other content on the Websites is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If you find that a Product you purchase is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in accordance with G2MC &#8216;s Return Policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The purchase of Products on the Websites is subject to availability.

<p><b>b. Pricing and Payments</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prices displayed through the Services are firm and in Canadian dollars, which may be converted to other currencies at the time of payment processing, depending on your country of origin and / or credit card account agreement. Prices do not include applicable sales taxes, delivery fees or any other applicable fees, which shall be displayed during the checkout process, depending on your location and selections you have made (for example delivery method). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By confirming your purchase at the end of the checkout process by clicking the Place Order button, you agree to pay G2MC the amount set out as the Total in the Order Summary section of the checkout process. The Total is quoted in Canadian dollars and includes shipping and handling fees, any applicable environmental or other additional fees, and all applicable taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we strive for accuracy in the pricing displayed on the Websites and the other product information we provide, errors can occur. In the event that a Product is mistakenly listed at an incorrect price, G2MC reserves the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed for product listed at the incorrect price. G2MC reserves the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and the Purchaser&#8217;s credit card or PayPal account charged. If the Purchaser has already been charged for the purchase and the order is cancelled, G2MC shall issue a credit to the credit card or PayPal account used to make the purchase in the amount of the incorrect price (plus any taxes and / or shipping or other fees).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a valid promotional code, it shall be applied and displayed during the checkout process once you enter the code. In the event that an incorrect discount is applied, G2MC reserves the right to refuse or cancel any orders listed at an incorrect discount. G2MC reserves the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or not the purchase has been confirmed and the Purchaser’s credit card charged.</span></p>

<p><b>c. Billing Information and Payment Processing</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to make a purchase of Products through the Services, you will be required to enter the credit card holder name, credit card number, credit card expiry date, card security code (CVV), and billing address if different from your delivery address. This may be referred to in these TOU or the Privacy Policy as “</span><b>Billing Information</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”. Your Billing Information must match the information associated with your credit card or PayPal account (as applicable) for the payment to be processed. In addition to the Billing Information, you must provide a telephone number and email address so that we can communicate with you about your order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All payments for Products made through the Services are processed using a secure https:// connection, and payment processing is handled through “</span><b>Third-Party</b> <b>Payment Processors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”, currently</span><a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Stripe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.paypal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">PayPal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though these are subject to change without notice. The Third-Party Payment Processors currently accept certain credit and debit cards (which shall be displayed to you upon making your payment) as payment options (as well as your PayPal account) but these are subject to change without notice. Once transactions are accepted by a Third-Party Payment Processor, they are processed in accordance with their program rules and procedures and Terms of Use. G2MC and the Third-Party Payment Processors are unaffiliated companies and G2MC has no influence on the operations of the Payment Processors. G2MC and / or its Representatives shall in no way be held responsible for any losses or damages, direct or indirect, pecuniary or otherwise, resulting from any error or failure on the part of the Third-Party Payment Processors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Billing Information is collected by the Third-Party Payment Processors, on their own secured servers. G2MC does not have access to any credit card information, nor can it be responsible for any breach of information caused by faulty programming or malicious users on the servers of the Third-Party Payment Processors. Non-financial information will, however, be available to G2MC for shipping and data-keeping purposes.</span></p>
<p><b>d. Shipping and Delivery</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delivery of Products is only available to certain provinces and locations, as will be displayed to you upon checkout.
